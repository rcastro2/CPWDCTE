We look to level the playing field by providing students three areas to explore computer science: art, video games, and physical devices.  We use Python to introduce concepts such as variables, mathematical operations, functions, decision making, loops, lists, objects, and libraries.  Students learn these concepts within the confines of the three areas of exploration.</p>

Teachers take on the role of a mentor to assist students in their projects.  In the past ideas have been implement using technologies such as iOS Development (Swift), Android Development (Java), Unity 3D (C#), IoT (Raspberry Pi, Python, Flask, SQLite), and Web Development(HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Firebase, APIs, JavaScript, Python, Google App Engine, PHP, MySQL).</p>
