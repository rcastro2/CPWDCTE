With their offices based in lower manhattan,a lot was going on inside such a small place. \u201cJust do it. It\u2019s unbelievable when I look at where I was 3 months ago and where I am now.\u201d said Jesse Schneider; A former Student and current instructor at TurntoTech.  \u201cDon\u2019t be intimidated if you\u2019ve never coded before. I had never even seen code before TurnToTech and was able to become a full-fledged programmer with a job in just 3 months. If this is something that you\u2019ve been thinking about trying, just do it\u201d. Jesse is one of the many people who learned to code after going to college for something completely different, Biology. Kevin Loyola, one of the CTE seniors at Bayside High School, was fascinated with what TurnToTech is doing. He explained \u201cTraditional education is no longer the norm nor the necessity in our real world environment.\u201d This is very true; skills are a necessity, and traditional education needs to catch up in order stay up to date with today's opportunities.</p>                        <p>Students sat down with instructors from TurnToTech to not only understand what they were doing, but what Bayside\u2019s CTE program teaches students. They exchanged ideas and presented projects. One of the TurnToTech students was developing a map that combined the likes of Google Maps and Yelp. Groups from Bayside High School presented their educational websites focused on chemistry and geometry using technologies such as JavaScript, Bootstrap and Firebase.</p>            <p>While sharing numerous ideas, it was fascinating to talk to people that completely changed their career path and tried something new.

The conference rooms ranged from single spaced cubicles to full-fledged discussion rooms, and even a miniature-sized room.

The company stresses employee success is determined by impact made, not by the amount of work they have done. </p>            <p>Students were led back into the meeting room, where they were greeted by three of Facebook\u2019s employees.

This innovation allows a person to move freely within a 3D virtual environment of real indoor locations.</li><li>Can  you play a piano made of bananas and celery?  Anything is possible when you close a circuit, according to Geek Academy in conjunction with BestBuy.</li><li>There were many of innovations related to consumer\u2019s health, such as \"UpRight\", a portable application that monitors a wearer\u2019s posture.  The wearer receives a gentle vibration if their posture slips out of alignment.</li><li>Real life robots are topics of many futuristic sci-fi movies.  Nano states \u201cthe future is getting nearer\u201d as they showcased a miniature robot that walks, kicks and interacts with humans.</li><li>Need a new knob for a door?  Is the latch on your zipper broke? Well, why not just print it out?  MakerBot\u2019s 3D printer allows the user to do exactly that with organic liquids.</li><li>Perhaps traveling along on a futuristic self-powered skateboard, like in the movie Back to the Future is more your speed.
